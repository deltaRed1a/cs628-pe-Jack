Cities Application Analysis
Input
The Cities application receives user input through two main interfaces. On the "Add City" screen, users provide city information including name, country, and population through text and number input fields. The navigation system accepts user clicks to switch between "Cities List" and "Add City" pages. Additionally, users can click on individual city names in the cities list to view detailed information. All form inputs are validated to ensure required fields are completed before submission.
Process
The application manages state using React's useState hooks to store the cities array and track current page navigation. When users add a new city, the form data is processed to create a city object with a unique timestamp-based ID, then added to the cities array. The navigation system uses conditional rendering to display different components based on the current page state. City selection triggers a state update to show detailed information within the same layout. Form submission automatically redirects users back to the cities list, demonstrating programmatic navigation.
Output
The application renders a responsive interface with a dark header containing the navigation menu and a main content area displaying the current page. The Cities List shows clickable city names that expand to show detailed information including country and population when selected. The Add City form provides a clean interface for data entry with real-time validation feedback. Success messages and automatic redirection provide user feedback after form submission. All output is styled with modern CSS for an appealing, user-friendly experience that matches the provided mockup designs.
