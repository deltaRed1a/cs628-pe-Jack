# Input
The input is the static data of Jack Gilbertâ€™s resume, including his name, email, education, skills, experience, and projects. This information is hard-coded in a functional React component called Resume.js.

# Process
React renders the Resume component inside App.js. Styling is applied using Resume.css, which includes layout formatting and color. The project was bootstrapped using Create React App and executed in GitHub Codespaces.

# Output
The output is a clean, styled resume webpage with a bright background (rgba #bdfb04), default black text, organized resume sections, and responsive layout. It demonstrates a working React app served locally.
